# bionical_eye_controller
A conceptual Python program for controlling a simulated bionic eye device with augmented features such as changing iris color, zoom, night vision, augmented reality overlays, and more. This project demonstrates auto-installation of dependencies (using the `--break-system-packages` flag) and simulates USB/wireless communication with the device.
